What is Pysmb ?
===============

It is an experimental SMB/CIFS library written in Python.


What It Can Do
==============

It can run on Python 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. I have already tested them on my machines. 
Since the whole library is written in pure Python, it should be able to run 
on any Python-supported platforms. 
It can upload/download/copy/rename/remove/list files and directories that are
shared in user mode.
From version 0.2.0, pysmb also supports encrypted authentication in DES.
However, you can turn off encrypted authentication on these machines by
using these registry files (Win95, Win98, Win2000, NT4) in the extra directory
From version 0.3.0, pysmb allows operations on services in share mode. Previous
versions only support services in user mode.
From version 0.4.0, pysmb uses NT LM0.12 dialect to communicate with the SMB 
server. Note that this is only a partial implementation, so it might fail on
some systems

What It Can't Do
================

Note that this is only a client library. It does not share files. 


Utilities
=========

Pysmb also includes some simple utilities which I hope can help to demonstrate 
the use of pysmb. These are working applications which I feel will be very 
useful. 

- nmbquery
  This is very similar to Samba's nmblookup but is quite very limited in its 
  functionality 
 
- smbdu
  This displays the disk usage of the files/directories recursively like the 
  Unix's du program. 
  
- smbcp
  Performs files/directory copy to/from your local machine and the remote SMB 
  machine. 

- smblistshare
  List the available share devices on the remote SMB machine.


How To Install
==============

Simply put smb.py and nmb.py together with your Python source files and 
import them. Please use 
   import smb, nmb

and not 
   from smb import *

This is because smb.py defines a number of constants which might interfere 
with your project's variables. For more information about the API, please 
consult the documentation in the docs directory, or look at the accompanying 
utilities for ideas.
